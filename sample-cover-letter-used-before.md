Hiring Manager Wurl Remote (United States)

**Full Stack Software Engineer Intern Application**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Software Engineer Intern position at Wurl. As a final-year Computer Engineering student with a 4.45/5.00 CGPA and extensive practical experience in both front-end and back-end development, I am eager to contribute to Wurl’s mission of accelerating the shift to streaming through innovative AdTech and CTV solutions. My background in building scalable web applications, coupled with my experience working in remote, cross-functional teams, aligns perfectly with the dynamic engineering culture at Wurl.  
During my tenure as the ReactJS Frontend Lead for Sandsstores (Pennsylvania, USA), I gained direct experience thriving in a remote environment while leading the development of a high-performance e-commerce platform. I utilized Next.js and Tailwind CSS to design intuitive UIs and successfully managed deployment using Vercel with AWS S3 integration. This role honed my ability to write clean, maintainable code and resolve complex performance challenges—skills directly applicable to the responsibilities of designing and deploying software applications at Wurl.

My technical toolkit fits your stack requirements precisely. I possess strong proficiency in **Python** and **JavaScript**, backed by hands-on experience with frameworks like **React** and **Django**. As a Software Engineer Intern at Zuri Inc, I demonstrated my full-stack capabilities by developing database schemas for a Favicon Generator web app and prototyping cloud migration solutions using **PostgreSQL**. Furthermore, I coordinated a team of technical interns, an experience that strengthened my communication and teamwork abilities—key soft skills emphasized in your job description.  
In addition to web development, I bring a rigorous approach to quality and performance from my current role as an AI Model Quality Analyst at Turing. There, I review code for compliance and tune machine learning models, ensuring I bring a detail-oriented mindset to code reviews and testing at Wurl. My familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure further positions me to support your engineering team effectively from day one.  
I am passionate about technology and eager to learn from the experienced engineers at Wurl while contributing to projects that impact millions of viewers. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and drive can support your team’s goals.

Sincerely,  
**David Oluwafemi**
